This is a test. I am using the version I downloaded the other day. It seems ronen has made some changes, by pulling these updates my test file remained (with another message here) and Ronens updates were merged in also. 

Deleting this file (or adding/deleting another file) should be an equivalent experience. 

I now go to terminal, commit this message and push the updates. 

You should be able to go to gitkraken and pull, then make changes, commit and push back.
