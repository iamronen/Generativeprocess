#### Throwing an Invitation
After feeling the wholeness of the goal proposed in the [[Invitation to Crew]], and the generativity of the Invitation to Crew as a first transformation to achieve it, the Invitation   to Crew can be thrown to the [[Invitation Pond]]. That thrown will be marked in the [[Personal Totem]] and in the [[Pinup Board]].
