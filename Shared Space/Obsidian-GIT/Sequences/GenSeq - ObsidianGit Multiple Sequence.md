### Sequence: Organizing Multiple Sequence in Obsidian/GitHub

#### Purpose
Extending the basic file and folder structures for projects that include numerous linked generative sequences. 

#### Sequence
1. Isolate the transformations from the initial sequence of the project:
	1. In the project's "Transformations" sub-folder create a sub-folder for the initial sequence. The folder name can be the sequence name.
	2. Move the existing notes (the transformations of the initial sequence in the project) from the "Transformations" folder into the sub-folder created for the sequence.
2. For each additional sequence create a dedicated sub-folder to hold the separate transformations.
3. If sequences are grouped together (within the overall narrative of the project) this can also be reflected in the organizations of the transformation sub-folders. An aggregating folder can be created within the Transformations sub-folder and the sub-folders for the aggregated sequences can be moved into it.
