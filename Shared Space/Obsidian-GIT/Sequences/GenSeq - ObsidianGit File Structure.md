### File Structure for Generative Sequences in Obsidian/GitHub

#### Purpose
Effective-practices for arranging files that make up generative sequences.

The following sequence assumes that a sequence is either part of a project (a collection of linked sequences) or a project on its own (of only one sequence).

##### Sequence
1. In the "Sequences" sub-folder create a note named "GenSeq - InsertSequenceName" for the generative sequence and initiate the note with a [[ObsidianGit Generative Sequence Template]].
2. For each of the  transformations in the sequence create a note in the Transformations folder.
3. Add your sequence to the Index document.
4. If your project includes more than one sequence see [[GenSeq - ObsidianGit Multiple Sequence]].
