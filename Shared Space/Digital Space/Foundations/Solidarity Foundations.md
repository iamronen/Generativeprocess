# Solidarity

When people are in relationship with each other and the natural world so that everyone and everything thrives, that is solidarity. When in solidarity, people recognize and embody the reality that we only exist in relation to others. We only discover and realize our gifts, and our needs are only truly fulfilled, when we are in healthy, equitable relationships with others.

1. The transformation is misplaced. There is already a folder named "Foundations" in the "Transformations" folder and this transformation belongs there.
2. The name of the transformation not does not need to include "Foundations" especially once it is placed in the  correct "Foundations" folder.
3. The transformation is missing a level 5 heading of its name "Solidarity"
4. It is better to author and relate to a transformation in sequence especially one that is being added to an existing established sequence). and not on its own. It does not stand on its own needs to be assessed (both authored and read) within its place in a sequence. Therefore the transformation needs to be included in [[GenSeq - Foundations]].
5. I feel that the word "only" is too fierce, and unnecessarily excluding (even if you feel its true and it may be true!). Below is an offer of alternative wording.

Alternative Wording
Solidarity is when people are in relationship with each other and the natural world so that everyone and everything thrives. Solidarity elicits an embodied experience of relationship and belonging. Solidarity enables us to discover and realize our gifts, to experience fulfillment, and to partake in healthy, equitable relationships with others.
