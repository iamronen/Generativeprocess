# Values

This inquiry is directed into an exploration of values. Given the current scarcity of money in our ecologies we intuit that there may be a shortage of the money-substance to adequately resolve tensions. The left-over tensions are carried over from the math-of-money to alignment of values. This becomes an investment in our future.
