# Value Agreement

A value agreement can be much more than a price. A value agreement is an intentional mutual effort to create a sense of shared value. As such, a value agreement is a potentially rich social dynamic. A value agreement of “price and payment” is merely one simplified example of a value agreement. There can be more elaborate value agreements.
