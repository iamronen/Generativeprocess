##### Positive & Negative Signaling

Signals can be made positive or negative. For example, I am interested / I am not interested. Though there can be a social and emotional tendency to prefer and gravitate towards positive signaling,. However, negative signaling has a quality of clarity that is valuable in finding and moving towards cohesion. As we move closer towards that which is sacred it becomes more difficult to express (positively) what it is. It may become more clear and intuitive to say what the Sacred is not. Sending and receiving negative signaling can be emotionally sensitive.
