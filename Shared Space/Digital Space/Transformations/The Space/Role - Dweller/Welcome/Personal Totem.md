##### Personal Totem

If you do join the space and it is the first space you join, the host gives you a blank personal Totem. Your totem represents you in the spaces you partake in. Your totem is shaped through carving (where material is removed). Almost anything you do in the space will cause an etch in your totem. Like the form of a snowflake captures the journey of the snowflake through the atmosphere, so does your totem capture the history of your participation in all spaces in the structure. In this case, joining the space will be etched into your totem.

If you are already a member of other spaces in the structure then you already have a personal totem. In this case your Totem will be etched to indicate joining this space.

Over time, you will learn more about your Totem and how it is shaped and perceived by others.
