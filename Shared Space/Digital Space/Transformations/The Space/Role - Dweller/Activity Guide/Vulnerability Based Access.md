##### Vulnerability Based Access

Some activities may require of you more vulnerability than others. The activity guide will highlight for you activities that are suitable for your vulnerability mode (see: GENSEQ: Interest Signaling). The activity guide can also direct you, if you wish, to activities that may advance your capacity for vulnerability. Increase capacity for vulnerability will, in turn, effect your ability to participate in other activities and better connect with and relate to others in the space.
