##### Doorway

You arrive at a doorway. On it you find an inscription with two parts. The first part tells you to read the second part out loud. You follow the instruction and read out loud the second part and discover it is a short statement about the nature and purpose of the space that awaits you behind the door. When you are done reading, the door magically swings open.
