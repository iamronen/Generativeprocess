##### Sitting Corner

In the entrance niche is a small sitting corner with a pinup board, a low table, and two wide, soft, and inviting cushions. When you enter the corner you have a sense of privacy, you can no longer see the people in the space and they can no longer see you. You sit in one of the cushions and feel as it embraces and welcomes you, perfectly responding to your body.
